Introduction
============

red-fab-deploy is a collection of Fabric scripts for deploying and managing projects created with red-start. License is MIT.

This project is specifically targeted at deploying websites built using the red-start project creation tool. Basically this means you must be using git and follow the same folder and file layout as found in that tool.

This project was inspired by `django-fab-deploy <http://packages.python.org/django-fab-deploy>`_ and `cuisine <https://github.com/ff0000/cuisine/>`_.

These tools are being geared towards deploying on Joyent but can be extended to be used on other providers.
